The Association of Veterinary Medical Students (AVMS) Ahmadu Bello Univsersity (ABU) Zaria Chapter gave me a project to compile handout, textbooks, powerpoints, and pass questions (PQs) among other things into a single digital library in a project we are calling "Encyclopaedia Veterinariae".
I am currently done with the earlier phases of the project. I've compiled and sorted the resources given to me in the first phase of the project. I then uploaded those materials on Google Drive of the AVMS Gmail account and allowed access to anyone with the link.
The next phase is to create a website for AVMS. This is to make the entire project more user friendly. The website would also be used for other relevant things by the association. The website, for now, is not for hosting of the materials and resources; but rather to ultimately link to the contents of the Google Drive.
The website would also have pages about other relevant information. There would be pages about AVMS that would be dedicated to information and facts about the association such as the current AVMS officials, patrons, Faculty officers (including Dean, Assistant Dean, Exam Officer and the many others). Also, a contact us page, where someone can leave a message would be provided. These however, may be reserved for later parts of the project.

The Vet Medicine here in ABU Zaria is a 6-year programme divided into 6 different levels (100L - 600L). Each level has two semesters (1st and 2nd). It is worth noting that 100L is called Pre DVM; 200L called DVM I; 300L called DVM II; 400L called DVM III; 500L called DVM IV; and 600L called DVM V. The project is structured into different classes and semesters, then into the respective courses. Then directory for 'other resources'.
